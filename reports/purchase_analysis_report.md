# Purchase & Product Analysis — Generated artifacts

This short report lists files generated during the product and purchase data preparation steps.

## Generated datasets and plots
- `meltano-ingestion/db/prod_name_english.csv` — product_id → product_category_name_english (32,951 rows)
- `meltano-ingestion/db/prod_category_counts.csv` — counts and percent per product category (71 rows)
- `meltano-ingestion/db/prod_category_counts_top10.png` — top-10 categories bar chart

- `meltano-ingestion/db/purchase_time_citystate.csv` — merged orders + customers (99,441 rows)
- `meltano-ingestion/db/orders_by_state_total.csv` — total orders per state
- `meltano-ingestion/db/orders_by_month_state_top_states.csv` — monthly orders for top states
- `meltano-ingestion/db/orders_over_time_top_states.png` — monthly time-series for top states
- `meltano-ingestion/db/top_cities.csv` — city-level order counts
- `meltano-ingestion/db/top_cities_top20.png` — top 20 cities bar chart

## Reproducibility
All steps are implemented in `leslie.ipynb`. To re-run locally:

1. Activate your conda env (or use the kernel with pandas installed).
2. Open `leslie.ipynb` and run the notebook cells in order; cells will save the CSVs and PNGs under `meltano-ingestion/db`.

## Suggested next steps
- Create interactive Plotly charts for exploration.
- Add these CSVs to a data/processed folder and consider ignoring large files with `.gitignore` if necessary.
